# WARNING
This project is currently in the initial development stage and does not yet have **any** usable functionality whatsoever. If any of the scripts even run it's purely coincidental, and you're encouraged to stay **clear** of running any of them for as long as the project is in this stage, as it might potentally cause accidental harm to run them in this unfinished, experimental and debugging oriented stage in a production environment.
